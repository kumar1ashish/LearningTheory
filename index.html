    <h2>Definition of Learning</h2>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <p>A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.</p>

<p>Choice of P very important!! - Expert system or human comprehension? - Datamining!!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Broad enough to include most tasks that we would call &quot;learning tasks&quot; but also programs that improve from experience in quite straightforward ways (rote learning or caching)!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A database system that allows users to update data entries - it improves its performance at answering database queries, based on the experience gained from databases updates (same issue as what is intelligence)</p>

    <h2>Concept Learning</h2>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <blockquote>
<p>Much of learning involves acquiring general concepts from specific training examples.</p>

<p>Each concept can be viewed as describing some subset of the objects or events defined over a larger set.</p>

<p>Alternatively each concept can be thought of as a boolean-valued function defined over this larger set.</p>

<p>Concept Learning - inferring a boolean-valued function from training examples of its input and output</p>

<p>How shall it be represented?</p>

    <h2>Direct versus Indirect Learning</h2>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <ol>
<li>Individual checkers board states and correct move for each</li>
<li>Move sequences and final outcomes of various games played.</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
<p>Credit Assignment Problem - the degree to which each move in the sequence deserves credit or blame for the final outcome - game can be lost even when early moves are optimal, if these are followed later by poor moves or vice versa</p>

    <h2>Teacher or not?</h2>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <p>Degree to which learner controls the sequence of training examples</p>

<p>Teacher selects informative board states &amp; provides the correct moves.</p>

<p>For each proposed board state the learner finds particularly confusing it asks the teacher for correct move</p>

<p>Learner may have complete control as it does when it learns by playing itself with no teacher - learner may choose between experimenting with novel board states or honing its skill by playing minor variations of promising lines of play</p>

    <h2>Choose Training Experience</h2>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <p>How well training experience represents the distribution of examples over which the final system performance P must be measured</p>

<p>P is percent of games in the world tournament, obvious danger when E consists of only games played against itself (probably can&#39;t get world champion to teach computer!)
most current theories of machine learning assume that the distribution of training examples is identical to the distribution of test examples</p>

<p>It is IMPORTANT to keep in mind that this assumption must often be violated in practise.</p>

<p>E: play games against itself (advantage of getting a lot of data this way)</p>

    <h2>Choose a Target Function</h2>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <p>ChooseMove: B -&gt; M where B is any legal board state and M is a legal move (hopefully the &quot;best&quot; legal move)</p>

<p>alternatively, function V: B -&gt;R which maps from B to some real value where higher scores are assigned to better board states
now use the legal moves to generate every subsequent board state and use V to choose the best one and therefore the best legal move</p>

<slide class="" id="slide-8" style="background:;">
  <hgroup>
    <h2>Choose Rep. for Target Func.</h2>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <p>Use a large table with an entry specifying a value for each distinct board state</p>

<p>Collection of rules that match against features of the board state </p>

<p>Quadratic polynomial function of predefined board features</p>

<p>Artificial neural network</p>

<p>NOTICE - choice of representation is closely tied to an algorithm choice!!</p>

<h2>Expressibility Tradeoff</h2>

<p>Very expressive representations allow close approximations to the ideal target function V,
but the more expressive the representation the more training data the program will require in order to choose among the alternative hypothesis</p>

<p>Also depending on the purpose, a more expressive representation might make it more or less easy for people to understand!!</p>

    <h2>Choose Function Approx. Algo.</h2>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <p>First need Set of training examples</p>

<p><b,Vtrain(b)>
&lt; (z1=3,z2=0,z3=1,z4=0,z5=0),+100&gt;   because z2=0
Vtrain(b)&lt;- V1(Successor(b))</p>

<p>good if  V1 tends to be more accurate for board positions closer to game&#39;s end</p>

<h2>Choose Learning Algorithm</h2>

<p>Learning Algorithm for choosing weights   W1 to best fit the set of training examples  {<b,Vtrain(b)>}={<b,V1(Successor(b)>)</p>

<p>Best fit could be defined as minimizes the squared error E</p>

<p>We seek the weights that minimize E for the observed training examples.</p>

<p>We need an algorithm that incrementally refines the weights as new training examples become available &amp; is robust to errors in estimated training values.</p>

<p>One such algorithm is LMS (basis of Neural Network algorithms)</p>

    <h2>Least Mean Squares</h2>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <p>LMS adjusts the weights a small amount in the direction that reduces the error on this training example</p>

<p>Stochastic gradient-descent search through the space of possible hypothesis to minimize the squared error</p>
